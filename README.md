# Logic-for-Computer-Scientist
This course is an introduction to mathematical logic and its use within computer science, including logic programming. The course included three labs which can be found in the folders labb1, labb2, and labb3.

- Lab 1: The basics in prolog. Tha lab had three partial tasks and can be found in the folders lab1.1, lab1.2, and lab1.3. 
- Lab 2: A program with an algorithm that checks whether a proof in natural deduction is true or false. The code for the program can be found in the file "labb2.pl". The text files are different tests the program needs to pass in the assignment. 
- Lab 3: A program that is a model checker for CTL that does evidence searching. The folder structure is the same as lab 2, the code can be found in the file "labb3.pl" and the text files are different tests.
